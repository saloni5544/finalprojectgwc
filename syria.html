    The unemployment rate in Syria and other countries is defined as the number of unemployed people as percent of the labor force. The labor force includes the people who are either employed or unemployed, i.e. who don't have a job but are actively looking for one. The labor force does not include people who are not looking for work, children, and the retired. The unemployment rate seldom declines below 4-5 percent even during boom times. There are always people who move between different sectors of the economy or between cities. When the economy goes into recession, then unemployment can reach much higher numbers, sometimes even in the double digits.
